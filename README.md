# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Washing Machine Market
### Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on washing machine product data collected from e-commerce platforms. The objective is to uncover meaningful insights, trends, and customer engagement patterns to support business decision-making.

###  Business Problem
The washing machine market is highly competitive with multiple brands and product types. Customers often struggle to choose the right product as they are influenced by factors like price, brand reputation, machine type, and capacity. Businesses lack clarity on what drives customer engagement and reviews.

### problem Statement
Analyze washing machine product data to identify:
Pricing trends
Brand influence
Customer engagement patterns
Impact of price, brand, and machine type on reviews

 ### Objectives
Understand dataset structure
Perform data cleaning & preprocessing
Conduct Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate analysis
Apply statistical test cases to validate insights

###  Dataset Overview
Source: E-commerce product listings
Rows: ~600 products
Columns: 9
Features:
Product_Name
Brand
Capacity_kg
Machine_Type (Semi / Fully Automatic)
Load_Type (Top / Front Load)
Color
Price (INR)
Discount_%
Reviews_Count

###  Data Cleaning Steps
Handled missing values in Price, Discount, Capacity, Reviews
Converted price & discount to numeric format
Removed empty Machine_Type values
Standardized data types

### Univariate Analysis
Major brands dominate product listings
Most machines fall in mid-price range
Capacity 6–8 kg is most common
Reviews distribution is highly uneven

### Bivariate Analysis
Budget products receive higher engagement
Higher price ≠ more reviews
Strong brand influence on reviews
Different pricing strategies across brands

### Multivariate Analysis
Reviews vary by brand & price segment
Some brands perform well even in budget range
Brand reputation impacts engagement more than price
Product & pricing strategies differ by brand

### Statistical Test Cases
ANOVA Test: Reviews vary significantly across brands
Chi-Square Test: Brand specialization by machine type
Comparative Analysis: Price weakly related to reviews

### Key Insights
Price alone does not drive customer reviews
Brand reputation is the strongest factor
Mid-capacity machines dominate the market
Semi-automatic models have high availability

### Business Applications
Identify high-engagement brands
Improve marketing strategies
Optimize pricing & discounts
Support inventory planning
Enhance demand forecasting

### Recommendations
Strengthen brand visibility
Adopt value-based pricing
Optimize product mix by capacity & type
Improve low-performing products
Use data insights for strategic decisions

### Future Scope
Add ratings & sales data
Build ML models to predict reviews
Perform sentiment analysis
Develop price optimization models

### Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
